CCFoundation
============

UIKit categories, utilities and other helpful snippets. Tasks I find helpful across all apps.

## Some Examples

```obj-c
// Lot's of useful little NSString methods...
- (NSString *)incrementIntegerValue; // e.g. @"1" -> @"2"
- (BOOL)isValidEmail;
+ (NSString *)stringRepresentationOfNumberOfBytes:(uint64_t)numOfBytes; // e.g. 102.95 KB
```

```obj-c
// Many new UIView methodsâ€¦
- (UIViewController *)firstAvailableUIViewControllerOfType:(Class)type;
- (UIView *)viewWithTagObject:(id)object;
```

```obj-c
// Get a random pastel-color
+ (UIColor *)randomPastelColor;
```

```obj-c
// MKMapView
- (void)centerMapOnAnnotations;
```

```obj-c
// Expand UITextFields dynamically to text.
- (CGFloat)setText:(NSString *)text andExpandVerticallyUpTo:(CGFloat)maxHeight;
```

```obj-c
// Who wants to type in all that unnecessary code?
+ (UIImageView *)imageViewWithImageNamed:(NSString *)imageName;
```
